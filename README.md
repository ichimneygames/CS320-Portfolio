# CS320-Portfolio

I ensure my code is functional and secure by using the tools given to me to fix issues as they become apparent. I also test my code as I complete each section of it, comparing to the end user needs to ensure a complete program. 
I interpret user needs by either writing down the goals they are looking for in a complete program, or for the case of school, refer to the guidelines and take each part step by step to ensure my final program is up to standards.
I approach designing software by gathering the proper information before I actually start coding, I also create the required files as needed to not confuse myself by creating too many files at once.
